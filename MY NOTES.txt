What is an issue?
In Jira, teams use issues to track individual pieces of work that must be completed. Depending on how your team uses Jira, an issue could represent a project task, a helpdesk ticket, a leave request form, etc. In Jira, issues typically represent individual work items such as big features, user requirements, and software bugs. You can update issues to show work progress or add relevant information such as who is assigned to the work, in-depth description, or attachments.

1]Epic:Represents a larger body of work. Epics are often represented as a collection of multiple issues.
Example: Start a lemonade stand.

2}Task
Represents a task that needs to be done. Tasks are used as ‘catch-alls’ and when the work cannot be accurately represented by the other issue types.
Example(s): Make lemonade. Create sign. Set-up stand.

3}Story:Represents a requirement expressed from the perspective of the user.
Example: As a lemonade enthusiast, I’d like to have a really cold, crisp drink.

4]Bug:Represents a problem that needs to be fixed.
Example: The lemonade is too sour.

5}Sub-task:Represents a more granular decomposition of the work required to complete a standard issue. A sub-task can be created for all issue types.
Example: Squeeze lemons.
